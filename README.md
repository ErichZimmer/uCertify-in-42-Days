# uCertify-in-42-Days
A completion challenge for a course where I have 42 days to obtain a 90% completion or higher on a uCertify Javascrpt course. 

## Update
This challenge was no longer possible due to the course being locked behing a LMS after the two week grace period. This course is still locked as of this update (2024/10/27).

## What is uCertify?
uCertify is an online learning platform covering several topics. In my case, it covers Javascript and its runtime environments and libraries (e.g., Node.js and React.js). It contains reading modules and interactive labs where one can apply what they learned to gain some additional hands-on experience. 

## The Challenge
While I do not necessarily have to do all lessons to complete the university course requirements, I decided that the best outcome of that course is to do a lesson a day for all lessons (42 lessons). 

## Structure of repository
All lessons are self-contained and will be placed in their own folders located in `./lab_{K.M.N}}`. All other files will be located in the root directory (e.g., README.md).
